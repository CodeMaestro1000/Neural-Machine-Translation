## Implementing an English to German Translation Model with TensorFlow

This project makes use of a Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) model for English-German Translation. It was implemented using TensorFlow's encoder-decoder model and Bahdanau and Luong's Attention Mechanism algorithm. 

See https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/nmt_with_attention#write_the_encoder_and_decoder_model and https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt#background-on-the-attention-mechanism for more.

The entire project was written in python.
